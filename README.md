# Bitso-Node-API

`npm install bitso-node-api`

A Node.js API Wrapper for the [Bitso REST API](https://bitso.com/api_info). Please refer to [their documentation](https://bitso.com/api_info) for the responses and parameters.

```javascript
var BitsoNode = require('bitso-node-api');
// Key and Secret are only necessary if you use the Private REST API
var bitsoClient = BitsoNode.BitsoClient({ 
  key: '1234',
  secret: 'secret',
 });

bitsoClient
  .public
  .availableBooks()
  .then(books => {
    console.log(books.prices);
  });

```

##How to Use

```javascript
const BitsoNode = require('bitso-node-api');

const client = BitsoNode.BitsoClient({
  key: "KEY",
  secret: "SECRET",
});

// Public API
client.public.ticker({
  book: BitsoNode.exchanges.BTC_MXN
})
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
  
// Private API
client.private.accountStatus()
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

To use private API methods that move any currency or change account
information you need to create the API client with the `authorizeMovements` parameter ser to true.

(REMEMBER TO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!)
```javascript
const BitsoNode = require('bitso-node-api');

const client = BitsoNode.BitsoClient({
  key: "KEY",
  secret: "SECRET",
  authorizeMovements: true
});

client.private.placeOrder({
  book: BitsoNode.exchanges.BTC_MXN,
  side: 'buy',
  type: 'market',
  minor: '10000',
})
  .then(res => console.log(res))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
```
